Title: PyWeek 40 - Part 2: Submission
Summary: In which I successfully submit my entry!
Friendly_Date: the morning after the submission deadline
Series: 1gam
Tags: gamedev, python, pygame

I did it! I actually managed to submit an entry for [PyWeek
40](https://pyweek.org/40), which finished at 1am this morning. My game is
called **Loco Lift Rush**, and it's a simple puzzle-action game (I think?) in
which you control a lift in an ever-growing skyscraper, picking up and dropping off
a continuous stream of motley passengers.

### Time well spent

I was very pleased with how I managed my time this week, this was largely thanks
to a ruthless focus on keeping the scope of the game manageable. Sometimes
it really pays to ["Murder your darlings"][1].

For instance, my original plan was to have the building grow dynamically
_during_ play. My vision was for the top floor to be a perpetual construction
site, complete with animated workers. I'd even sourced a whole library of
construction sound effects to bring it to life. But my first draft of the art
looked so janky without any animation and I realised there just wasn't time to
do the idea justice.

Cutting that feature was the right decision, as it let me focus on the core game
loop and get it mostly done by the second day, which gave me a huge boost of
momentum that carried through the rest of the week.

### Outsourcing art direction

To start with, I was struggling with the visual theme of the game - in my head I
saw 1930s New York, art-deco skyscrapers and uniformed elevator operators. But
then my 6 year old daughter Romilly started drawing her own ideas for the game's
passengers.  Her characters were so imaginative and fun that I decided to use
them unchanged with only a light cleanup in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). They
give the game a charming, quirky style that I never could have designed myself.

The sound effects were all taken from
[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/), and I edited them with
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - particularly the lift moving sound,
which I chopped up to make it fit with the lift starting and stopping.

The final boss that I couldn't defeat was the music. I'm not a musician (yet),
and composing even a single looping track filled me with dread, so I put it off
until I ran out of time. This is definitely the first thing I want to tackle in
the post-jam version. I have been experimenting with [Bosca
Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net/), which is really simple and fun to use, so lets
see what I can come up with.

### What next?

The list of ideas for improvements and new features is as long as my arm, and
we're only just over a week into the second month of my [one game a month
challenge](/1gam). So I will continue to work on Loco Lift Rush, and
release an updated version. Some upgrades I have in mind are:

- Music
- More passenger types, with different behaviours and patience levels -
  partcularly passengers who add buffs and debuffs to the lift (e.g. a rocket
  man who makes the lift go faster, or an elephant who makes it go slower)
- Dynamic difficulty progression - reinstating the mechanic of adding floors
  during play - maybe after you serve a certain number of passengers, or after a
  time limit.
- Animations
- And of course, bug fixes and polish

I'll also be writing a post-mortem, after the PyWeek judging results are in. I
hope you'll give Loco Lift Rush a play and enjoy this little game that was built
in just one week!
