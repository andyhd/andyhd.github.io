## **[Loco Lift Rush came in 5th place!!!][1]**

I'm absolutely thrilled and so grateful to all my fellow PyWeek entrants who
voted for and critiqued my game, and especially to my daughter Romilly, whose
gorgeous drawings were the most praised part!

I had a [great time making it][2], and while I never dreamed it would be received
so well, I had a good feeling about [how it came together][3].  Getting feedback
from the other jammers is brilliant - it makes me wish there was a Pyweek every
month!

Entering a game jam is a great way to push yourself to finish something, and
honing those skills is one of my main goals for my [one game a month
challenge][4]. So what have I learned?


## Lesson 1: Getting Out of My Own Way
I really like pixel art. It makes me nostalgic for the games of my youth, and I
always want to make games that look like them. But while I'm decent at drawing
with pencil and paper, pixel art is a whole different skill
set that I just haven't put the hours into.

So I decided from the start to avoid getting bogged down in pixels, and use
hand-drawn art instead. This allowed Romilly to join in, which was so much fun
for both of us, and gave the game a unique and charming look. In fact, a number
of the judges commented on how much they loved the art style, and I think that
was a big part of why the game did so well.

Romilly was absolutely made up by the attention her drawings
got, and she's already planning our next collaboration.

I used a cheap USB drawing tablet to copy Romilly's drawings into GIMP, which
made it really easy to digitize them, resize them, and [load them as assets in
Pygame][12].  Doing this was quick and painless, and I'll definitely be
using this approach again.


## Lesson 2: Publish and Be Damned
While the praise and constructive criticism I received from the other jammers
was ego-boosting and really motivating, I was mortified to discover that a
couple of them couldn't run the game. I made the schoolboy error of only testing
in my development environment, and not on other machines or Python versions.

The bug was that a function I used ([`random.normalvariate`][13]) to set how
long to wait between each passenger's arrival used to have 2 mandatory
parameters, but in Python 3.11 a default value was added for the second, and I
only tested on Python 3.13. So anyone using Python 3.10 or earlier just got a
error message saying I'd missed a parameter. Cringe.

Making mistakes teaches you a lot more than getting everything right. Even in a
low-stakes environment like a game jam, the embarrassment of a show-stopping bug
is a lesson I won't soon forget.


## Lesson 3: There's Nothing New Under the Sun
After submitting my game, I did a quick search on [itch.io][5] to see if I had
actually invented anything new. It turns out that there are already quite a few
incredibly similar games out there. Unexpectedly, this was reassuring - there is
clearly a fun game to be made here, and I am not the only one who has thought of
it!

Here are some of the ones I found particularly interesting:

- [Elev√°ngel][11] (2022)
- [L'ascenseur Magnifique][9] (GMTK Game Jam 2021)
- [Smooth Operator][10] (2021)
- [Ele-Gator][6] (2020)
- [Elevator Pitch][7] (GMTK Game Jam 2019)
- [Elevator Panic][8] (LD37 2016)

Some have interesting mechanics that I wish I'd thought of. For example,
[L'ascenseur Magnifique][9] makes the lift ascend slower with more passengers
but descend faster - a neat trade-off that makes the game more strategic.

Seeing other people's takes on the same idea is fascinating and has given me
more ideas for how to improve Loco Lift Rush.


## Lesson 4: Horse Trading
A game jam (and perhaps all game dev) is an excercise in ruthless trade-offs.
I'd failed to learn this in previous attempts, but this time it finally clicked.

I deliberately started with *greyboxing* (using simple boxes to represent the
lift and passengers) to get the game mechanics working first, and scheduled the
art for later in the week. As a result, I avoided getting distracted drawing
pixel art and was able to get a playable version done by the end of the second
day, which really boosted my confidence!

But I had to cut a lot of features that I wanted, like different passenger
types, power-ups, and a continuously growing building.  I didn't have enough
time to make animations and music, or to fine-tune the pacing
of the game or give it a definitive ending.


## What Next?
I have a long list of ideas for improvements and new features...

But I am out of time for month 2 of my [one game a month challenge][4]!

Rule #1 is **One Game a Month** (and only one game at a time!)
so I have to set Loco Lift Rush aside for now. It's tough to walk away with so
many exciting ideas, but I will definitely be coming back to it - watch this
space!
