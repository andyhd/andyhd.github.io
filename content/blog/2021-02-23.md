Title: Link rot


I was reading back through my exchanges with friends on Twitter and I was
disappointed with how many web links are broken, only a few years since they
were created.

This website is no better, as I constantly rebuild it and break all the old URLs
in favour of a new and questionably improved structure.

They say that once something is on the web it is there forever, but it really
depends on what that thing is. It seems the web is very similar to human memory
in this way. Over time, pieces of information can become inaccessible or lost.
Provocative or titillating tidbits attract many more links and remain accessible
for longer.
