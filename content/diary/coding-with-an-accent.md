Summary: Polyglot programmers plagued by clumsy code
Status: draft

The majority of popular programming languages are essentially the same. Four of the top 5
languages of the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) (as of January 2021)
are C family languages, and Python is not a radical syntactic departure. It's not that
suprising, given how languages have been developed: gradually evolving families of
languages and cross-pollination giving rise to new mutations.

It certainly makes it easier for programmers to learn a new language, because they can
use large chunks of their experience with language A to quickly be able to
contribute to a project written in language B.

What I find interesting is how the similarities between languages and their flexibility
(TIMTOWTDI) allow a programmer who is fluent in one language to write working code in
another language, but in the *accent* of the former.
